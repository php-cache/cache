This repository has a adapter that makes any PSR-6 pool taggable. All PHPC ache pools support tagging out of the box. 
Using tags allow you to tag related items, and then clear the cached data for that tag only. It is a part of the PHP Cache 
organisation. To read about features like tagging and hierarchy support please read the shared documentation at [www.php-cache.com](http://www.php-cache.com). 

### Install

```bash
composer require cache/taggable-cache
```
